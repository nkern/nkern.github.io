Connecting data to theoretical predictions from sophisticated and compute-intensive simulations is often prohibitively expensive. A solution is to use machine learning methods to emulate the mapping of the simulation's input parameters to its output products with a less computationally expensive surrogate model. We explored this in the context of a cosmological 21 cm simulation, paying careful attention to the problem of propagating emulator uncertainty. Leveraging <a href="/code">emulator acceleration</a>, this work demonstrated for the first time a joint parameter forecast across both cosmological and astrophysical Cosmic Dawn parameters. Since this work, nearly all current 21 cm Cosmic Dawn inference packages have gone on to adopt similar emulator techniques.
