My collaborators and I have developed the main HERA calibration and analysis pipeline. I've worked specifically on custom software for <a href="https://github.com/HERA-Team/hera_qm" target="_blank">data quality metrics</a>, <a href="https://github.com/HERA-Team/hera_cal" target="_blank">calibration and systematic treatment</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/HERA-Team/hera_pspec" target="_blank">power spectrum estimation</a>, with a particular emphasis on systematic models. All software is unit tested, peer-reviewed, and has documentation in each respective repository for getting started with the code.
