A framework for building end-to-end, differentiable Bayesian forward models for solving the toughest inverse problems in line intensity mapping (LIM) cosmology.
Currently, the field of radio LIM cosmology is at a crossroads: we now have loads of experimental data that could shed light on unsolved problems in astrophysics and cosmology; however, there are massive contaminants in the data that prevent us from robustly extracting this information.
To tackle this, I have developed the first end-to-end, differentiable Bayesian forward model for LIM science that will try to break new ground in extracting the long sought-after cosmological signals in these noisy and messy experimental datasets.
This approach is made possible by the advent of high-level automatic differentiation software libraries and large-memory, high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs) for accelerating this computationally demanding approach.
