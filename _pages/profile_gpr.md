The scientific potential of 21 cm cosmology is currently hindered largely by bright galactic and extragalactic foreground emission. Many techniques have been proposed to model and subtract such foregrounds, although none of proven sufficient on real data to yield a detection of the 21 cm power spectrum. In this paper, we revisit a popular technique for foreground modeling using Gaussian processes (GP), and show that such a data model is in fact closely related to the widely studied inverse covariance model used in CMB and optical galaxy surveys. Furthermore, we show that improper normalization of a GP-based data model can lead to non-negligible bias in the recovered power spectrum. We show how one can mitigate this bias by compromising overall sensitivity.
