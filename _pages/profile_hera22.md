The <a href="https://reionization.org/" target="_blank">Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array</a> (HERA) is a new radio interferometer that aims to detect the 21 cm signal from cosmic hydrogen at the Epoch of Reionization and Cosmic Dawn. I led the first analysis of HERA Phase I observations, which set world-leading constraints on the EoR power spectrum (pink triangles) in 2022. Our z=8 limits improved upon existing limits by over an order of magnitude in sensitivity. These gains were due largely by my analysis pipeline's careful accounting of systematics, and the development of new tools for systematic mitigation that I led (see below).

This companion paper used a suite of theoretical methods to interpret HERA's first power spectrum upper limits and set constraints on the properties of the intergalactic medium (IGM) at redshifts 8 and 10.4. Principally, this analysis shows that the HERA limits require the IGM to be heated above its adiabatic cooling limit by z=8 (purple arrow). This implies that early X-ray sources from the first galaxies (e.g. from high-mass X-ray binaries) must have been more luminous than their local-universe analogues, and is consistent with a population of low-metallicity HMXB. This is the most stringent constraint on the X-ray properties of compact objects at Cosmic Dawn to date.
