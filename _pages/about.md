<a href="https://space.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Kavli Institute for Astrophysics</a>.
I am a data-focused researcher working at the interface of high-redshift astrophysics & cosmology, radio astronomical observation and machine learning.
My research goals are to use next-generation radio telescopes to map the high-redshift universe with unprecedented statistical precision, enabling us to tap into a trove of currently unharnessed cosmological information.
Some of the broad questions my research aims to address are:

* When did the first stars, black holes, and galaxies form, and how did their radiative feedback impact the surrounding primordial hydrogen?
* How do high-redshift observations of the universe fit with low-redshift observations, and can we use them to detect deviations from our standard cosmological model?
* How can we robustly and optimally extract weak cosmological signals from noisy data, and how can advances in machine learning accelerate this process?

I leverage data from <a href="https://reionization.org/" target="_blank">powerful radio telescopes</a>, and design novel, ML-driven analysis frameworks for addressing these questions.
My <a href="/bayeslim">current work</a> is in developing the first fully end-to-end and differentiable Bayesian forward model for the wide range of 21 cm cosmology and line intensity mapping experiments.

Previously, I was a <a href="https://physics.mit.edu/research/pappalardo-fellowships-in-physics/" target="_blank">Pappalardo Fellow</a> at MIT. I received a PhD in astrophysics from UC Berkeley in 2020, and a BS in physics and astrophysics at the University of Michigan in 2015.
