<h2>
Research
</h2>

&nbsp
My research interests span a variety of fields, but I am currently doing active research in two main areas. I use radio astronomy to characterize the physical conditions of the ISM in starburst galaxies, and to study young stellar objects. I also use simulations and spectrscopic surveys to study galaxy clusters and cosmology.

<h3>
Galaxy Clusters
</h3>

&nbsp
Since April 2012, I have been working with <a href="https://www.lsa.umich.edu/astro/people/millerchris_ci" target="_blank">Professor Chris Miller</a> and graduate student Dan Gifford, studying dynamical mass estimators of galaxy clusters in simulations and spectroscopic surveys, specifically the <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999MNRAS.309..610D" target="_blank">Caustic Technique</a>.
We use the caustic technique to derive mass estimates of galaxy clusters using the velocity dispersion of the member galaxies. Knowing the mass of local and far away galaxy clusters plays an important role in cosmology, and can help constrain the physical parameters of the universe.
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013ApJ...773..116G" target="_blank">Gifford et al. 2013</a> showed that the caustic technique suffers high uncertainty errors at low sampling. Many of known clusters in large spectroscopic surveys suffer from low number statistics, and are therefore effectively un-usable to dynamical mass estimators like the caustic technique.
To try and remedy this situation, I have been studying the effectiveness of stacking galaxy clusters of similar properties, in order to increase the sample size and decrease uncertainty errors.
This method does not give us mass estimates on a per cluster basis: stacking eliminates this possibility.
However, if cluster stacking really works, and we stack clusters that we deduce are similar, then we may be able to better understand, in general, the dynamical propeties of a large sample of galaxy clusters at varying redshifts.
Initially we used the Millennium simulation, a large N body computer simulation that models the growth of structure in the universe, to test the technique in a situation where we can recover the "real" mass of a cluster, the mass the simulation says it is. We cannot do this with real observational data because we do not know what the "real" mass of a cluster is in space. Now that we better understand the limits and uncertainties of our technique, we can confidently use it on observational galaxy cluster catalogues.
The process of systematically stacking galaxy cluster phase spaces to determine mass estimates, to our knowledge, has never been succesfully applied to dynamical mass estimators, and will therefore yield unprecedented results. This work is the subject of my senior honors thesis in astronomy.

<h3>
Radio Astronomy
</h3>

&nbsp
Over the summer of 2013 I was a summer student at the <a href="https://science.nrao.edu/opportunities/student-programs/summerstudents" target="_blank">National Radio Astronomy Observatory</a> (NRAO) in Charlottesville, VA, participating in the NSF funded REU program.
While I was there, I worked with <a href="http://www.cv.nrao.edu/~jmangum/" target="_blank">Dr. Jeff Mangum</a> and used the <a href="http://www.vla.nrao.edu/" target="_blank">Very Large Array</a> (VLA) to image insterstellar formaldehyde (H2CO) in starburst galaxies to characterize the physical conditions of the dense gas fueling the starburst activity.
I was able to fully reduce, calibrate and analyze raw VLA data from two starburst galaxies using CASA, and derived spatial densities of the dense molecular hydrogen.
My summer work resulted in a  <a href="images/AAS_Poster.pdf" target="_blank">poster presentation</a> at the 223rd American Astronomical Society Meeting in Washington, D.C.. 
This work will also be put into a paper that I will use as my senior honors thesis in physics. 
<br>

&nbsp
While I was working at the NRAO, I also conducted a side project with some of my summer student colleauges. We used the VLA to image the Serpens South protostellar region, and sucessfully reduced and calibrated the data to detect radio signatures of protostars previously undetected at this particular wavelength. I am currently working on compiling these results into an academic paper with my colleages.
